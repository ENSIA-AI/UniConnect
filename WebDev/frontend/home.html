                        Never lose hope of finding your missing items again! Our Lost & Found Board is a dedicated space where students can 
                        report items they've lost or found on campus. Each post includes a detailed description, category classification 
                        (such as Books, Electronics, Clothing, or Personal Items), and optional images to help identify the item. The 
                        platform makes it easy to search through listings and reunite students with their belongings quickly and efficiently.

                    <p>
                        Studying alone can be challenging, but finding the right study partners shouldn't be! Our Study Group Finder connects 
                        students based on courses, modules, and study goals. You can create or join study groups, specify your preferred meeting 
                        times, share your study focus areas, and coordinate with classmates. Whether you're preparing for exams, working on 
                        projects, or just need help understanding complex topics, this feature helps you find motivated peers to study with.
